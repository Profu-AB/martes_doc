- the installation process will install WSL on your windows 10 / Window 11 system if its not already installed
- if wsl is not installed then it will install it. This step requires local admin rights and also a reboot after the WSL installation is complete.
- then we will use the Ubuntu-22.04.05 distribution as a base for the new WSL container "Ubuntu-Profu".
